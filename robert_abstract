Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are a simple and effective means to connect multiple devices that may enter, move around, and leave at will.

Because good.

Many security issues rise as a result of wireless ad-hoc networks. In some use cases, all peers involved could be well defined and unknown or bad nodes could easily be rejected, however in the case of VANET and sometimes UWSN, it is unfeasible to attempt "hard wiring" all nodes because they come and go at will. The security issue focues on is "node reliability", meaning how well can a particular node be trusted to participate appropriately in an ad-hoc network.
