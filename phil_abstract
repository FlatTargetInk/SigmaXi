In the underwater domain, a network of sensor nodes which communicate with eachother can be used for purposes such as collecting statistcal data (temperature, tide and currents, fish activity, etc.), monitoring industrial activity, and relaying locational coordinates of military deployments.
The vast and unpredictable nature of the ocean draws a need for a wide network, consisting of various sub-networks and types of devices which collect data in different ways for different purposes. An infrastructure-based network would be highly impractical and in some situations technically impossible to use; ad-hoc networks are cheaper and more adaptable to the unpredictable situations which may arise under the sea.
As UWSNs are used for not only general environmental and industrial purposes, but for the military as well, an attack on a UWSN of large-scale could harm the integrity of warfare tactics, and also be very expensive. These networks are relatively new technology, especially ones which include autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), making them a target for hackers and those with malicious intent.
In a scenario where underwater wireless sensors are communicating using encryption, an attacker could record packets being sent, and use them to send fake messages to nodes, either causing them to operate in a certain way, or forcing them to deny service to other nodes, rendering them useless in the network. When packets are intercepted and later used by attackers, it is called a man-in-the-middle or replay attack. The research efforts will serve to prevent these attacks and strengthen the security of wireless networks.
