Wireless Sensor Networks enable communication among devices which collect and transfer various types of data. They collect statistical data underwater, monitor industrial activity, and communicate traffic information between cars, just to name a few examples. In the cases of underwater environments and self-driving cars, Ad-Hoc (without structure) networks are used. Under the sea, the vast and unpredictable nature of the ocean requires a wide network, consisting of various sub-networks and types of devices which collect data in different ways for different purposes. Similar logic can be applied to Vehicular Networks which interact with different nodes (cars, etc.) on each use. A small scale attack could cause major disruptions locally; large-scale attacks could be incredibly harmful, with the chance of giving away strategic locations and be very expensive. As these networks are relatively new technology, especially ones which include autonomous underwater vehicles and self-driving cars, it is important to expose flaws and find solutions. This research aims to do just that, with the intent of making ad-hoc networks of autonomous vehicles more robust and secure.
