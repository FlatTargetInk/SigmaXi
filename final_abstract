Wireless Sensor Networks can be used so nodes communicate with each other to be collect statistical data underwater (temperature, tide and currents, fish activity, etc.), monitor industrial activity, or to communicate traffic information between cars. Ad-Hoc networks for Under Water Sensor Networks make sense because the vast and unpredictable nature of the ocean draws a need for a wide network, consisting of various sub-networks and types of devices which collect data in different ways for different purposes. Similar logic can be applied to Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks when different cars enter and leave the networks constantly. A small scale attack could cause major disruptions locally and large-scale attacks could harm the integrity of warfare tactics, and be very expensive. These networks are relatively new technology, especially ones which include autonomous underwater vehicles and self-driving cars, making them a target for malicious actors. One attack is a replay attack, which effects could range from using up bandwidth to sending outdated information, disrupting services and large operations. This research examines solutions to a replay attack.
